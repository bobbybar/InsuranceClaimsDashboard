# InsuranceClaimsDashboard
This project explores and visualizes insurance claims data to uncover key trends and insights. It simulates the kind of exploratory data analysis and dashboarding that underwriters and actuaries use to assess risk, loss patterns, and claim frequencies.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis with `pandas` and `seaborn`
- Dashboard prototype with `Streamlit` (optional)
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Visual insights on claim frequency, amount distributions, and more

## Structure
- `data/`: Sample datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `app/`: (Optional) dashboard code using Streamlit
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
